        <li><strong style="text-indent:30px;"> Advocacy toward a healthy university:</strong> Since
                    establishment of AUN-HPN, the network has advocated for the health promotion concept. As
                    part of
                    our
                    efforts, the AUN Health University Framework (HUF) was developed (in 2017) and has become a
                    significant output of the network as it has been used as a powerful tool to advocate for a
                    healthy
                    university in the Asian region. Anecdotally, awareness on the importance of health promotion
                    and
                    appreciation in a critical role of higher education institutions in addressing public health
                    problems have been raised among AUN member universities. Many of our members have adopted
                    the
                    health
                    promotion concepts and implementing the HUF in their universities. <br> <span>We are
                        collecting
                        data
                        from our member universities on implementation progress toward HUF, including lessons
                        learned,
                        key success factors and barriers to the implementation. These data will be important
                        feedback to
                        the AUN-HPN Secretariat for the assessment on how well the HUF is being implemented and
                        if
                        it
                        has been implemented as expected. The collected data will also facilitate development of
                        programs and future planning to support member universities to efficiently and
                        effectively
                        implement the health promotion concept, and to further strengthen health promotion
                        capacity
                        of
                        member universities in the future. </span></li>
                <li> <strong> Health promotion capacity building:</strong> Although health promotion is not a
                    new
                    concept but it is a discipline which is often neglected at higher education institutions. As
                    health
                    promotion by its nature applies a holistic and multi-sectoral approach, AUN-HPN has put
                    great
                    efforts to build up capacity of our member universities. They could then gain more knowledge
                    and
                    understanding in the health promotion concept. In the past couple of years, we focused on
                    health
                    promotion research and leadership. Therefore, we arranged two technical workshops to build
                    up
                    skills
                    and respond to our priority needs. </li>
                <li><strong> Knowledge and experience sharing:</strong> Knowledge and experience sharing is
                    considered
                    as a key component of networking activities. Therefore, AUN-HPN has been providing
                    opportunities
                    as
                    many as possible to our member universities for their knowledge and experience sharing.
                    Apart
                    from
                    learning from each other, AUN-HPN also invite regional and international experts to share
                    their
                    expertise with our members. We believe that knowledge and experience sharing among members
                    themselves and with the experts will broaden perspective in health promotion and lead to
                    more
                    innovative approaches and strategies in dealing with public health issue in our members’
                    country.
                    Another outstanding effort to promote knowledge and experience sharing is the organization
                    of
                    the
                    AUN Health Promotion Conference, and the next one will be organized in Manila on 20-21
                    August
                    2019.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Health promotion research collaboration:</strong> AUN-HPN has encouraged our
                    members to
                    develop a collaborative research project among themselves and with other academic partners.
                    In
                    2018,
                    AUN-HPN was successful in providing a platform for our members to discuss and develop a
                    collaborative research project on non-communicable diseases. In parallel with this project,
                    another
                    research project on physical activity has successfully been granted (for 3 years during
                    2018-2021)
                    and will start the implementation by the first quarter in 2019. This successful grant will
                    be a
                    demonstration project to our members on how to work together and generate the knowledge
                    required
                    to
                    improve public health and wellbeing.</li>
